### Prior to starting the security release work

- [ ] Read the [security process for developers] if you are not familiar with it.
- [ ] Mark this [issue as related] to the Security Release tracking issue. You can find it on the topic of the `#releases` Slack channel.
- [ ] Run `scripts/security-harness` to prevent pushing to any remote besides `security/omnibus-gitlab` and `dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab`
- Fill out the [Links section](#links):
  - [ ] Next to **Issue on Omnibus GitLab**, add a link to the `gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab` issue that describes the security vulnerability.
  - [ ] Next to **Security Release tracking issue**, add a link to the security release issue that will include this security issue.

### Development

- [ ] Create a new branch prefixing it with `security-`
- [ ] Create a MR targeting `master` on [`security/omnibus-gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/omnibus-gitlab) and use the [Security Release merge request template]
- [ ] Follow the same code review process: Assign to a reviewer, then to a maintainer.

After your merge request has been approved according to our approval guidelines, you're ready to prepare the backports

#### Backports

- [ ] Once the MR is ready to be merged, create MRs targeting the latest 3 stable branches
   * At this point, it might be easy to squash the commits from the MR into one
- [ ] Create each MR targeting the stable branch `X-Y-stable`, using the [Security Release merge request template].
   * Every merge request will have its own set of TODOs, so make sure to complete those.
- [ ] On the "Related merge requests" section, ensure all MRs are linked to this issue.
   * This section should only list the merge requests created for this issue: One targeting `master` and the 3 backports.

#### Documentation and final details

- [ ] Ensure the [Links section](#links) is completed.
- [ ] Find out the versions affected (the Git history of the files affected may help you with this) and add them to the [details section](#details)
- [ ] Fill in any upgrade notes that users may need to take into account in the [details section](#details)
- [ ] Add Yes/No and further details if needed to the migration and settings columns in the [details section](#details)
- [ ] Add the nickname of the external user who found the issue (and/or HackerOne profile) to the Thanks row in the [details section](#details)
- [ ] Once your `master` MR is merged, comment on the original security issue with a link to that MR indicating the issue is fixed.
