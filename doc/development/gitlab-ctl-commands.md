# Adding new `gitlab-ctl` commands

New `gitlab-ctl` commands can be added to two directory : `files/gitlab-ctl-commands` and `files/gitlab-ctl-commands-ee`. Chef stores `gitlab-ctl` commands in `/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/omnibus-ctl`.

There are two main functions you will use to add commands (<https://github.com/chef/omnibus-ctl>):

## add_command_under_category(string, string, string, int, ruby_block)

This method will add a new command to your ctl under a category, useful for grouping similar commands together logically in help output.

Input arguments:

1. Name of the command.
1. Category of the command. It should be string consisting of only characters and "-". If the category does not exist, it will be added. Default categories are "general" and "service-management" (if the latter is enabled).
1. Description. This will be outputted below the command name when the help command is run.
1. Ruby block. Ruby code to be executed when your command is run (arguments to that command will be passed into the block).

## add_command(string, string, int, ruby_block)

This method will add a new command to your ctl without a category. It will be displayed above all categories when the help command is called.

Input arguments are the same as `add_command_under_category` except 2 doesn't exist.
