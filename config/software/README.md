## Software Definitions

Most of the software definitions provided in this folder are adapted from [omnibus-software](https://github.com/chef/omnibus-software/tree/master/config/software). Initially, omnibus-software was used directly so that the definitions need not be redefined by Omnibus GitLab. But, omnibus-software [later stated](http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/06/30/omnibus-a-look-forward/) that it does not intend to provide a comprehensive list of definitions, but will support only the software definitions that are a required part of their product pipelines. So, it was decided that Omnibus GitLab should ship its own copy of software definitions. This, even though increased clutter, provided two advantages: a canonical location for definitions of all softwares used by Omnibus GitLab, and ability to modify the definitions as necessary without the need of specifying overrides.
