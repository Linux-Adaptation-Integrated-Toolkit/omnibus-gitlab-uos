name 'rsync'

# This version is affected by CVE-2017-16548. However, rsync is not directly
# used by GitLab codebase. It is provided to be used in two manual tasks -
# backup/restore rake task and wrapper script for moving repositories to a new
# location. Since the scope of this vulnerability is limited, we decided to
# wait for next release of rsync rather than patching it. For details, check
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/3391
